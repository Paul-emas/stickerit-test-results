# The Task

Using the wireframes we've provided try to to create the menu for both mobile
and desktop. We don't expect you to be able to create everything to pixel
perfection in the allocated time

Must haves:

- Read the menu from `src/menu.json`
  - You might need to update it, or suggest another structure if unsuitable for
    your implementation
- Working menu/desktop menus (even if not feature complete)
- Use of appropriate MUI components (e.g. Button)
- Update the README.md with:
  - What you'd do if you had more time
  - Refactor the Navbar component by splitting the code into smaller components
  - Add Types instead of using the 'any' keyword
  - Use the atomic desgin folder structure
  - Create stories for major component
  - Work on the desktop searchbar
  - What design or UX improvements you'd make?
  - Add Skeleton loader while fetching data from a remote server
  - Simplify the menu structure (e.g data from CMS and reimplement the mega menu approach to have less options)
  - Move megamenu links to the footer

Not required:

- Searchbar
